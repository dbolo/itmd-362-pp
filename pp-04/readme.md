# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://www.tutorialspoint.com/human_computer_interface/guidelines_in_hci.htm
* How you implemented it in your sketch: the information on IIT Website is so bulky, so many information on the site, get user confuse. I plan to make my site so simple to reduce time. on the login page, you will only have the login information

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/themes/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: another issue with the site is the lack of clarity. I will provide clear and direct  information, what you need to do and how

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/human-computer-interaction-hci-guidelines-amitabha-chakraborty
* How you implemented it in your sketch:Effectiveness: concern a userâ€™s ability to accomplish a desired goal or to carry out work
